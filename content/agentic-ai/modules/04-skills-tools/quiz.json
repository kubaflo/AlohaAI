      "question": "What is the primary purpose of tool use in LLMs?",
      "options": [
        "To make the model generate longer responses",
        "To allow the model to interact with external systems and take actions",

        "To replace the need for prompt engineering"

      "options": [
        "There is no difference — the terms are interchangeable",
        "A tool is a single function, while a skill is a group of related tools covering a domain",

      "options": [
        "Each function should handle as many responsibilities as possible",
        "Functions should have vague descriptions so the model has flexibility",

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Single responsibility and clear descriptions are essential. The model relies on descriptions to select the right tool, and focused functions are easier to chain together reliably.",
