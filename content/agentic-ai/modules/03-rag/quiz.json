        "Generate → Retrieve → Augment",

      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Embeddings capture semantic meaning, not just keywords. This is why queries like 'forgot my credentials' can match documents about 'password reset' even though they share no exact words.",

      "type": "MultipleChoice",
      "question": "What is the main purpose of adding overlap between chunks?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce storage costs",
        "To make embeddings more accurate",
        "To prevent losing context at chunk boundaries",
        "To speed up vector search"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Overlap ensures that information at the edges of one chunk is repeated in the adjacent chunk, so important context is not lost when a document is split.",

      "id": "q4",
      "type": "MultipleChoice",
      "question": "Which scenario is best suited for RAG rather than fine-tuning?",
      "options": [
        "Teaching a model to respond in a specific persona",

        "Reducing response latency by eliminating retrieval"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "RAG excels when the underlying data changes frequently. Fine-tuning is better for adjusting style, persona, or output format since those are stable behavioral changes.",

      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Ingestion (chunking, embedding, and storing documents) is an offline process that runs ahead of time or on a schedule. The query phase runs in real-time when a user asks a question.",
