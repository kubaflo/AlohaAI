      "options": [
        "It trains AI models to be more accurate",
        "It standardizes how AI applications connect to tools and data sources",
        "It replaces HTTP as the main web protocol",
        "It provides a database for storing AI model weights"

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "MCP is an open protocol that creates a universal standard for connecting AI applications to external tools and data sources, eliminating the need for custom integrations.",

      "options": [
        "It exposes tools and resources to clients",
        "It handles the JSON-RPC wire protocol",
        "It is the user-facing application that manages clients and enforces security policies",

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The Host is the application the user interacts with (e.g., an IDE or chat interface). It manages one or more MCP clients and enforces security policies and user consent.",

      "correctIndex": 1,
