# What Are AI Agents?

An **AI agent** is a system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals.

Unlike traditional software that follows pre-defined rules, agents use **large language models (LLMs)** as their reasoning engine to dynamically decide what to do next.

## Key Characteristics

- **Autonomy** — agents operate without constant human intervention
- **Reasoning** — they break down complex tasks into steps
- **Tool use** — they can call APIs, search databases, or execute code
- **Memory** — they maintain context across interactions

## A Simple Example

Imagine asking an agent: *"Find the top 3 trending AI papers this week and summarize them."*

The agent would:

1. Decide to search an academic paper database
2. Call a search API tool with relevant queries
3. Read and analyze the results
4. Generate concise summaries
5. Return the formatted answer

No human told it *how* to do each step — the agent figured out the plan on its own.

## Why Agents Matter

Agents represent a shift from **AI as a tool** to **AI as a collaborator**. Instead of writing prompts and getting text back, you can delegate entire workflows to an agent that orchestrates multiple steps independently.

> Agents are the bridge between "AI that answers questions" and "AI that gets things done."

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Code assistants** that can read your codebase, find bugs, and submit fixes
- **Research agents** that search, analyze, and synthesize information
- **Customer support** agents that resolve issues by querying databases and executing actions
- **Data pipeline** agents that extract, transform, and load data automatically
