      "question": "In the supervisor pattern, what is the role of the supervisor agent?",
      "options": [
        "It performs all tasks by itself without delegation",
        "It coordinates work by delegating subtasks to specialist agents and assembling results",
        "It only monitors system health and restarts failed agents",
        "It replaces agents that are too slow"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The supervisor agent acts as a coordinator — it receives the user's request, breaks it into subtasks, delegates each to a specialist agent, and assembles the final result.",

      "explanation": "In the shared chat history pattern, all agents participate in a single conversation thread and can read the full history. This provides full context visibility but increases token costs.",

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Event-driven communication decouples agents by using published events and subscriptions. Agents can be added or removed without changing existing agents, making the system highly scalable.",

      "type": "MultipleChoice",
      "question": "What is the purpose of a function call approval guardrail?",
      "options": [
        "To speed up function execution by caching results",
        "To intercept tool calls before execution and enforce policy checks on high-risk actions",
        "To automatically fix errors in function arguments",
        "To log function calls for billing purposes only"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Function call approval guardrails intercept tool calls before they execute. For high-risk actions like deleting data or sending communications, they can require approval, apply policy checks, or block the action entirely.",

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Defense in depth layers multiple controls: input filtering, function-level policies, output validation, and observability. No single guardrail is sufficient on its own for production systems.",
